# King-sFavor_BoardGame
This repo holds some documents for a board game 2 others and I created for a class in November 2015. 
It includes the map (incomplete, however), the cards associated with them, the rule book, and other art. 

Artwork for the board was made by me, Liliana Campuzano. Cards and rulebook were created by the other two collaborators, although we all worked together on the concepts, rules, and balancing of both the spaces and the card stats. 


MISSING: complete board with spaces, pieces
