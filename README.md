# King-sFavor_BoardGame
This repo holds some documents for a board game 2 others and I created for a class in November 2015. It includes the map (incomplete, however), the cards associated with them, the rule book, and other art. Artwork for the board and the cards were made by me, Liliana Campuzano. Card artwork and rulebook were created by the other two collaborators. MISSING: complete board with spaces, pieces
